== Installing {product-title}

Installing {product-title} consists of the following steps:

. Downloading the VHD image to your SCVMM Library.
. Creating a blank VHD to be used for the database disk.
. Running a PowerShell script to create a deployable template for the {product-title_short} appliance.
. Configuring the {product-title_short} appliance.

After you have completed all the procedures in this guide, you will have a working environment on which you can perform additional customizations and configurations.

.Requirements

Uploading the {product-title_short} appliance file to SCVMM requires:

* A Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager environment with at least one Hyper-V node.
* 44 GB of storage space.
* 12 GB RAM.
* 4 vCPUs.
* An Admin privileged account for the SCVMM environment

=== Obtaining the Appliance

Download the VHD appliance image to your SCVMM library:

. Log in to your SCVMM environment.
. In a web browser, navigate to link:manageiq.org/download[].
. Select *SCVMM* from the *--Choose your platform--* list.
. Select *Stable* from the *--Choose a release--* list.
. Follow the instructions to download the appliance to your SCVMM Library.
. When the image finishes downloading, open a PowerShell terminal and run `'Refresh-LibraryShare'`:
+
----
PS C:\Users\Administrator.MS01> 'Refresh-LibraryShare'
----

=== Obtaining the Appliance

Download the VHD appliance image from the Red Hat Customer Portal to your SCVMM library:

. Log in to your SCVMM environment and open a web browser.
. Navigate to the Red Hat Customer Portal *Downloads* page at link:https://access.redhat.com/downloads[access.redhat.com].
. Click *A-Z* to sort the product downloads alphabetically.
. Click *Red Hat CloudForms* to access the product download page.
. Log in using your customer account details when prompted.
. From the list of installers and images, click the *Download Now* link for *CFME SCVMM Virtual Appliance* and download to your SCVMM Library.
. When the image finishes downloading, open a PowerShell terminal and run `'Refresh-LibraryShare'`:

=== Deploying the Appliance

Create a blank VHD to be used for the database disk and add it to your SCVMM Library, create a template for the {product-title_short} appliance, then deploy a virtual machine to run the appliance.

. Create a blank VHD to be used for the database disk and add it to your SCVMM Library. Run this command on a node containing Hyper-V.
+
For example, on a node with Hyper-V installed you can create a 20GB blank VHD with the following PowerShell command:
+
----
PS C:\Users\Administrator.MS01> New-VHD -Path 'C:\path\to\my\newvdisk.vhdx' -SizeBytes 20gb -Dynamic
----
+
. Copy the blank VHD disk to the SCVMM Library.
. In a PowerShell terminal, run `'Refresh-LibraryShare'` to refresh the library:
+
----
PS C:\Users\Administrator.MS01> 'Refresh-LibraryShare'
----
+
. Run the following PowerShell script to create a deployable template for the {product-title_short} appliance, substituting values for your environment:
+
----
$networkName = "yourNetwork"
$templateName = "myNewCFMETemplate"
$templateOwner = "ownerUsername"
$memorySizeMb = 12288

$HWProfile `
    -JobGroup $JobGroupID02 -RunAsynchronously -Generation 1 -NoCustomization

----
+
. Deploy a virtual machine to a host group from the created template.
+
Run the following PowerShell script, substituting values for your environment:
+
----
$tpl = Get-SCVMTemplate -Name $templateName -VMMServer $scvmmServer
$vm_hg = Get-SCVMHostGroup -Name $hostGroup -VMMServer $scvmmServer
$vmc = New-SCVMConfiguration -VMTemplate $tpl -Name $vmName -VMHostGroup $vm_hg
Update-SCVMConfiguration -VMConfiguration $vmc
New-SCVirtualMachine -Name $vmName -VMConfiguration $vmc
----
+
[NOTE]
======
Substitute these values in your PowerShell script:

* $hostGroup = "NAME_OF_HOST_GROUP_TO_DEPLOY_TO"
* $scvmmServer = "NAME_OF_YOUR_SCVMM_SERVER"
* $templateName = "NAME_OF_CFME_TEMPLATE"
* $vmName = "NAME_OF_YOUR_NEW_VM"
======

Your SCVMM environment now contains a running {product-title_short} appliance which you can configure.
