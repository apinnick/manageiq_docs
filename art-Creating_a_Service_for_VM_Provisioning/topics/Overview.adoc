== Overview

{product-title} provides the ability to define services, which can include one or more virtual machines or instances, and can be deployed across hybrid environments. Services can be made available to users through the Self Service user interface, allowing users to order predefined IT services without IT operations getting involved.

The following three items are required to make a service available to users from the {product-title_short} Self Service user interface:

. *Service Dialog*: A service dialog is where you allow users to configure virtual machine or instance options. A service dialog determines which options users get to change. You can choose the options presented to the user, from setting the service name to changing all provisioning dialog options. 

. *Service Catalog*: A service catalog is used to group service dialogs together.

. *Service Catalog Item*: A service catalog item is the actual service which combines a service dialog with a provisioning dialog.
