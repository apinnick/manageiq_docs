== Examining the Provisioning Dialog

Understanding provisioning dialogs is important when working with services in {product-title_short}. Every provider in {product-title_short} comes with a sample provisioning dialog covering the options specific to that provider. The process begins with the provisioning dialog, which presents the basic configuration options for a virtual machine or instance. The options presented are dependent on the provider you are using. For instance, a cloud provider might have flavors of instances, whereas an infrastructure provider might allow you to set the memory size or number of CPUs on a virtual machine.

To see the sample provisioning dialog for Red Hat Virtualization: 

. Navigate to menu:Automation[Automate > Customization].
. Expand the *Provisioning Dialogs* accordion and select *Sample RedHat VM Provisioning Dialog* under *VM Provision*. 

This is a textual representation of the dialog you will get when you provision a virtual machine.
