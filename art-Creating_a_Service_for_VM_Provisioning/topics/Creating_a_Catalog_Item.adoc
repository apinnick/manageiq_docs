[NOTE]
====
In {product-title_short}, service catalog items can be more complex than a single virtual machine and are provisioned through a series of automation workflows. The service dialog you created will be used to gather information from the user requesting the virtual machine, hiding all the complexity of the details needed to actually deploy any of the components.

You can now provision a virtual machine through Red Hat Virtualization using the Self Service user interface.
