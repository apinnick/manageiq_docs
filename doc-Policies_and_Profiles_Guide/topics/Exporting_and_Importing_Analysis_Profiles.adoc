=== Exporting and Importing Analysis Profiles

{product-title_short} SmartState analysis requires an analysis profile to select the files to be scanned by a compliance policy. {product-title_short} has the ability to export and import SmartState analysis profiles via the command line using rake commands. As a result, approved configurations can be easily imported into customer environments, without having to manually recreate the profile through the user interface.

To export an analysis profile, run:

----
bundle exec rake evm:export:scan_profiles -- --outputdirectory
----

To import an analysis profile, run:

----
bundle exec rake evm:import:scan_profiles -- --sourcefile
----
