[[ldap_settings]]
= Configuring LDAP Authentication with IdM and Active Directory

Select *LDAP* or *LDAPS* to configure {product-title_short} authentication using Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), Active Directory, or another identity management service that uses LDAP protocol.

If you choose LDAP or LDAPS as your authentication mode, the required parameters are exposed under *LDAP Settings*. Be sure to validate your settings before saving them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure requires a preconfigured authentication system such as Red Hat Identity Management (IdM) or Active Directory (AD) with user groups configured.
====


For more information about Red Hat Identity Management, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/linux_domain_identity_authentication_and_policy_guide/index[Linux Domain Identity, Authentication, and Policy Guide] and related Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation.

[[ldap_config]]
== Configuring LDAP or LDAPS Authentication 

To configure {product-title_short} to use LDAP for authentication:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*. 
. Select your server in the *Settings* accordion.
. Select the *Authentication* tab.
. Select a *Session Timeout* to set the period of inactivity before a user is logged out of the console.
. Select *LDAP* or *LDAPS* from the *Mode* list. This exposes additional required parameters under *LDAP Settings*.
. Configure your *LDAP Settings* (the following example configures an IdM directory server):
* Use *LDAP Host Names* to specify the fully qualified domain names of your directory servers. {product-title_short} will search each host name in order until it finds one that authenticates the user. Note, {product-title_short} supports using a maximum of three possible *LDAP Host Names*.
* Use *LDAP Port* to specify the port for your directory server. The default is 389 for LDAP and 636 for LDAPS.
* From the *User Type* list, select one of the following and configure the values for your directory server:
** *User Principal Name*: Type the user name in the format of _user@domainname_, for example, _dbright@acme.com_. (In this case, the user would log on as _dbright_.)
** *Email Address*: Logs in with the user's email address.
** *Distinguished Name* (CN=<user>): Uses the common name for the user. Be sure to enter the correct *User Suffix* and *Distinguished Name* option for your directory service implementation: for example, _cn=dan bright,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com_. (The user logs on as _dan bright_.)
** *Distinguished Name* (UID=<user>): Uses the user ID (UID). Be sure to enter the correct *User Suffix* and *Distinguished Name* option for your directory service implementation: for example, _uid=dan bright,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com_. (The user logs on as _dan bright_.)
** *SAM Account Name*: User logon for Active Directory clients and servers using legacy Windows versions. You must also configure the *Domain Prefix* in the next field when selecting this option.
* Specify the *Domain Prefix* if you are configuring an Active Directory LDAP host, and selected *SAM Account Name* as the *User Type*. This field represents the prefix name in the Active Directory domain. Together with the SAM account name, this constructs the fully qualified user name in the format `<domain_prefix>\<user>`.
* Specify the *User Suffix*, such as _acme.com_ for *User Principal Name* or _cn=users,dc=acme,dc=com_ for *Distinguished Name*, in *Base DN*.

[NOTE]
====
The `ldapsearch(1)` command can be used to get details of your LDAP settings. To get details related to a specific user, run:

  # ldapsearch -D "cn=directory manager" -H ldap://www.acme.com:389 -b "dc=acme,dc=com" -s sub "(objectclass=*)" -w password | grep -i dbright

To search for your directory server's distinguished name (DN) values, run:

  # ldapsearch -D "cn=directory manager" -H ldap://www.acme.com:389 -b "dc=acme,dc=com" -s sub "(objectclass=*)" -w password

. Configure your *Role Settings*:
In both LDAP and LDAPS, you can use groups from your directory service to set the role for the authenticated LDAP user. The LDAP user must be assigned one of the account role groups. See xref:assigning_account_roles_using_ldap_groups[] for more information.
* For LDAP users not belonging to a group:
** Select a {product-title_short} group from the *Default Group for Users* list. This default group can be used for all LDAP users who use LDAP for authentication only. Do not select *Get User Groups from LDAP*, which will hide the *Default Group for Users* option.
* For LDAP users belonging to a group:
** Select *Get User Groups from LDAP* to retrieve the user's group membership from LDAP. This looks up all groups in the directory server for the user attempting to log in. This group list is matched against the available groups configured in {product-title_short}. Once a match is found, the role associated with the matching group identifies the authority the user will have on {product-title_short}. This requires group names on the directory server to match {product-title_short} group names. Selecting this box enables user records to be automatically created in {product-title_short} when a user logs in.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not select *Get User Groups from LDAP*, the user must be defined in the VMDB using the console where the User ID is the same as the user's name in your directory service typed in lowercase.
====
** Select *Get Groups from Home Forest* to use the LDAP groups from the LDAP user's home forest. This will allow you to discover groups on your directory server and create {product-title_short} groups based on your directory server's group names. Any user logging in will be assigned to that group. This option is only displayed when *Get User Groups from LDAP* is selected.
+
[NOTE]
====
In most environments, it is recommended to select both the *Get User Groups from LDAP* and *Get Groups from Home Forest* options.
====
+
** Select *Follow Referrals* to look up and bind a user that exists in a domain other than the one configured in the LDAP authentication settings.
** Specify the user name to bind to the directory server in *Bind DN*. This user must have read access to all users and groups that will be used for {product-title_short} authentication and role assignment, for example, a service account user with access to all LDAP users (named _svc-ldap_ in this example).
** Enter the password for the Bind DN user in *Bind Password*.
+
. Click *Validate* to verify your settings.
. Click *Save*.

LDAP authentication is now configured in your CloudForms environment.

To assign account roles using LDAP groups, see xref:assigning_account_roles_using_ldap_groups[].


[[trusted-forests]]
== Adding Trusted Forests

Optionally, if a user has group memberships in another LDAP forest, specify the settings to access the memberships in the trusted forest.

When trusted forests are added to the authentication configuration, they are used only for finding groups that a user is a member of. {product-title_short} will first collect all of the user's groups from the primary LDAP directory. Then it will collect any additional groups that the user is a member of from all of the configured forests.

The collected LDAP groups are used to match, by name, against the groups defined in {product-title_short}. The user must be a member of at least one matching LDAP group to be successfully authenticated.

To add another trusted forest:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*. 
. Select your server in the *Settings* accordion.
. Select the *Authentication* tab.
. Select *Get User Groups from LDAP*, and enter all items in the *Role Settings* area.
. In the *Trusted Forest Settings* area, click image:green-plus.png[](*Click to add a new forest*).
. Enter the *LDAP Host Name*, select a *Mode*, and enter an *LDAP Port*, *Base DN*, *Bind DN*, and *Bind Password*.
. Click *Save*.

After adding other trusted LDAP forests, you can then change the order in which {product-title_short} looks up the forests for authentication. For instructions, see xref:ldap_lookup_priority[].


[[assigning_account_roles_using_ldap_groups]]
== Assigning {product-title_short} Account Roles Using LDAP Groups

After configuring LDAP authentication as described in xref:ldap_settings[], you can associate {product-title_short} account roles with your LDAP users. The LDAP directory server defines the groups and users for {product-title_short}, while {product-title_short} defines the account roles, and maps the roles to the privileges the LDAP user has.

There are two ways to associate your LDAP groups with {product-title_short} account roles:

* Create groups in {product-title_short} that match your existing LDAP groups by name, and assign the groups account roles; or
* Create groups on your directory server based on the default account roles in {product-title_short}.

The users in your LDAP groups then inherit the {product-title_short} account roles for the LDAP group(s) they are in.

The authentication process then happens as such:

. _LDAPuser1_ attempts to log into {product-title_short}, so {product-title_short} queries the directory server to verify it knows _LDAPuser1_.
. The directory server then confirms that it knows _LDAPuser1_, and provides information about the LDAP groups _LDAPuser1_ belongs to: _Group1_.
. {product-title_short} then looks up _Group1_, and discovers that _Group1_ is associated with _Role1_.
. {product-title_short} then associates _LDAPuser1_ with _Group1_ in {product-title_short}, and then allows the user to perform tasks allowable by that role.


=== Mapping Existing LDAP Groups to {product-title_short} User Account Roles

This section provides instructions for mapping your existing LDAP groups to account roles in {product-title_short}. As a result, the users in the LDAP group will then be assigned to the {product-title_short} roles associated with that group.

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click the *Access Control* accordion, then click *Groups*.
. Click image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and image:plus_green.png[] (*Add a new Group*) to create a group.
. There are two ways to specify the group to use:
* In the *Description* field, enter the common name (_cn_) for your existing LDAP group assigned to users requiring access to {product-title_short}.
*  Select *Look Up LDAP Groups* to find a list of groups assigned to a specific user in LDAP, then use the *LDAP Group for User* list to choose a group.
.. In *User to Look Up*, enter the common name (_cn_) for a user in your LDAP group.
.. Enter the *Username*.
.. In *Password*, enter the user's password. Click *Retrieve*.
. Select a *Role* to map to the group.
. Select a *Project/Tenant* to map to the group.
+
image:Assign_LDAP-Roles.png[]
+
. Select any filters to apply to what this group can view in the *Assign Filters* area:
.. In the *My Company Tags* tab, select tags to limit the user to items containing those tags. The items that have changed show in a blue italicized font.
.. In the *Host & Clusters* tab, select the host and clusters to limit the user to. The items that have changed show in a blue italicized font.
image:2093.png[]
.. In the *VMs & Templates* tab, select the folders created in your virtual infrastructure to limit the user to. The items that have changed show in a blue italicized font.
. Click *Add*.

To configure the LDAP group lookup priority, see xref:ldap_lookup_priority[].


//=== Using Groups Named by {product-title_short} to Assign Account Roles

=== Creating LDAP Groups Based on {product-title_short} Account Roles

You can also configure access control for LDAP users by creating groups on your directory server based on {product-title_short} user account roles.

Your LDAP group names must match the account role names in {product-title_short}. The LDAP users in that group are then automatically assigned to that specific account role.

In your LDAP directory service:

. Define a distribution group for one or more of the account roles with the names shown in the table below.
This group must be in the LDAP directory source you specified for the server. See xref:ldap_settings[].
+
.Account Role and Directory Service Group Names

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Directory Service Distribution Group Name|Account Role
|EvmGroup-administrator|Administrator
|EvmGroup-approver|Approver
|EvmGroup-auditor|Auditor
|EvmGroup-consumption_administrator|Consumption Administrator
|EvmGroup-container_administrator|Container Administrator
|EvmGroup-container_operator|Container Operator
|EvmGroup-desktop|Desktop
|EvmGroup-operator|Operator

|EvmGroup-user_limited_self_service|User Limited Self Service
|EvmGroup-user_self_service|User Self Service
|EvmGroup-vm_user|VM User
|=======================================================================
+
. Assign each user of your directory service that you want to have access to {product-title_short} membership to one of these groups.

On your {product-title_short} appliance:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click the *Settings* accordion, then select your server under *Zones*.
. Click the *Authentication* tab and enable *Get User Groups from LDAP* after typing in all of the required LDAP authentication settings. See xref:ldap_settings[].


[[ldap_lookup_priority]]
== Configuring Lookup Priority for LDAP Groups

{product-title_short} can have multiple LDAP groups configured, which the appliance will attempt to authenticate with one by one until it succeeds. The lookup priority of these groups can be rearranged.

[NOTE]
====
On initial login, a user's _current group_ assignment is the highest priority group. User group membership, on subsequent logins, is set as the last assigned group from the prior session.
====

To configure the order in which {product-title_short} looks up LDAP groups:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click on the *Access Control* accordion, then click *Groups*.
. Click image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and image:plus_green.png[] (*Edit Sequence of User Groups for LDAP Look Up*) to prioritize which group a user will default to if LDAP returns multiple matching groups.
. Select one or more consecutive groups and use the arrow buttons to move the user group higher or lower in priority.
. Click *Save*.

== Testing LDAP Configuration

To test that your LDAP or LDAPS group configuration is working correctly with {product-title_short}:

. Log out of the {product-title_short} user interface.
. Log back in as an LDAP user that is assigned to one or more of the matching groups.
. Change groups by clicking on the user dropdown menu on the top right of the user interface. The dropdown list will show the groups the user is authorized for.

You can also check the logs in `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/audit.log` or `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/evm.log` to verify your LDAP configuration is working correctly with the following steps:

. Run the following command in a terminal to view the log messages in real time:
+
----
$ tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/audit.log
----
+
. Log into the CloudForms user interface as an LDAP user, while checking `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/audit.log` for updated status, success, or failure messages. Alternatively, you can test your LDAP configuration by viewing the logs in `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/evm.log` with `grep`, which are more verbose.


== Troubleshooting LDAP Configuration

To test a problematic {product-title_short} LDAP configuration, run the following command to see if the user been pulled from LDAP with the right group. For example:

----
# ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap-example:389 -LLL \ -b "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -s sub \ -D "ui=:userid,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -w :password \ "(objectclass=organizationalPerson)
----

To test if the user belongs to right group, include one of the following lines in the `ldapsearch` command above:

----
(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=yourUserName) (memberof=CN=YourGroup,OU=Users,DC=YourDomain,DC=com))
----

or

----
-b "ou=groups, dc=example,dc=com"
----
