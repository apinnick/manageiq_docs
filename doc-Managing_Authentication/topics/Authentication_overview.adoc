[[authentication_overview]]
= Introduction to Authentication in {product-title_short}

{product-title} provides several methods to authenticate users. Authentication can be configured from {product-title_short} using the local database, or {product-title_short} can use protocols such as LDAP and SAML to connect to a pre-configured authentication system such as Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO), Active Directory (AD), or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to use existing user accounts and groups.

This guide provides instructions to configure authentication management in your {product-title_short} environment as an administrative user.

After completing the setup of an authentication system, users can log in with their credentials.
