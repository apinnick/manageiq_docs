= Containers Providers

A containers provider is a service that manages container resources, that can be added to the {product-title} appliance.

{product-title_short} can connect to OpenShift Container Platform containers providers and manage them similarly to infrastructure and cloud providers. This allows you to gain control over different aspects of your containers environment and answer questions such as:

* How many containers exist in my environment?
* Does a specific node have enough resources?
* How many distinct images are used?
* Which image registries are used?

When {product-title_short} connects to a container's environment, it collects information on different areas of the environment:

* Entities such as pods, nodes, or services.
* Basic relationships between the entities, for example: Which services are serving which pods?
* Advanced insight into relationships, for example: Which two different containers are using the same image?
* Additional information, such as events, projects, routes, and metrics.

You can manage policies for containers entities by adding tags. All containers entities except volumes can be tagged.

[NOTE]
====
This chapter provides details on managing containers providers. For details on working with the resources within a container environment, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7-Beta/html-single/managing_infrastructure_and_inventory/#container_entities[Container Entities] in _Managing Infrastructure and Inventory_.

The {product-title_short} user interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent containers providers.
Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic information about each provider:

. Number of nodes
. Container provider software
. Power state
. Authentication status

.Containers provider authentication status

|		Icon  |	Description 
| image:2190.png[] | Validated: Valid authentication credentials have been added.
| image:2191.png[] | Invalid: Authentication credentials are invalid.

[[Obtaining_OpenShift_Container_Platform_Management_Token]]
= Obtaining an OpenShift Container Platform Management Token

When deploying OpenShift using `openshift-ansible-3.0.20` (or later versions), the OpenShift Container Platform link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/admin_guide/service_accounts.html[service account] and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html[roles] required by {product-title} are installed by default.

[NOTE]
====
See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[OpenShift Container Platform documentation] for a list of the default roles.
====

Run the following to obtain the token needed to add an OpenShift Container Platform provider:

  # oc sa get-token -n management-infra management-admin

= Enabling OpenShift Cluster Metrics

Use the OpenShift Cluster Metrics plug-in to collect node, pod, and container metrics into one location. This helps track usage and find common issues.

* Configure {product-title} to allow for all three https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.1/deployment-planning-guide/#assigning_the_capacity_and_utilization_server_roles[*Capacity & Utilization* server roles].

* Enable cluster metrics using the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.5/html-single/installation_and_configuration/#install-config-cluster-metrics[OpenShift Container Platform documentation].
