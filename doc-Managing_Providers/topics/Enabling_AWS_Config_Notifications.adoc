= Enabling AWS Config Notifications

Amazon's AWS Config notifies subscribers of changes in a region through its Simple Notification Service (SNS). {product-title} subscribes to the SNS service for AWS Config deltas and converts the deltas into {product-title_short} events.

. Enable the AWS Config service in the AWS Management Console.
  See the link:http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/config/[AWS Config Developer Guide] for more information.
. Create a new Amazon SNS topic named `AWSConfig_topic`.
  {product-title_short} automatically connects to this topic.
. (Optional) Configure the frequency of delta creation in the AWS Management Console.

You can assign {product-title_short} policies to the AWS events listed below.
The appliance performs a provider refresh on all these events except for `AWS_EC2_Instance_UPDATE`.
