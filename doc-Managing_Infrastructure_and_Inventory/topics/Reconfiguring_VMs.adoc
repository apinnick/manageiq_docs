[[Reconfiguring_VMs]]
= Reconfiguring Virtual Machines

Memory, processors, and disks can be reconfigured on existing VMware and Red Hat Virtualization virtual machines using the *Reconfigure this VM* button.

You can reconfigure multiple components on a virtual machine using one request, or make each reconfiguration separately. Confirm your changes using the *Submit* button.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following restrictions apply to adding and removing Red Hat Virtualization virtual machine disks:

* Supported by Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 and above.
* Only a single bootable disk is supported.
* The virtual machine requires at least one existing disk to allow adding additional disks. This is because the destination storage cannot be specified from the {product-title} dialog, so the storage associated with the existing disk is reused.
