=== Capacity and Utilization Collection

{product-title} server can collect and analyze capacity and
utilization data from your virtual infrastructure. Use this data to
understand the limitations of your current environment and plan for
growth.

For some capacity and utilization data, {product-title}
calculates and shows trend lines in the charts. Trend lines are created using linear regression, which is calculated using the capacity and utilization data collected by {product-title} during the interval you specify for the chart. The more data you have the better the
predictive value of the trend line.

There are three server roles associated with the collection and metric
creation of capacity and utilization.

* The Capacity & Utilization Coordinator role checks to see if it is
  time to collect data, somewhat like a scheduler. If it is time, a job
  is queued for the Capacity & Utilization Data Collector. The
  Coordinator role is required to complete capacity and utilization
  data collection. If more than one server in a specific zone has this
  role, only one will be active at a time.

* The Capacity & Utilization Data Collector performs the actual
  collection of capacity and utilization data. This role has a
  dedicated worker, and there can be more than one server with this
  role in a zone.

* The Capacity & Utilization Data Processor processes all of the data
  collected, allowing {product-title} to create charts.
  This role has a dedicated worker, and there can be more than one
  server with this role in a zone.

. In the *Credentials* area, click *C & U Database*.
. Type in the credentials for the new database user you created.
. Click *Save*.
. Restart the Capacity and Utilization Data Collector.

[[data_collection_for_rhev_4.x]]
=== Data Collection for Red Hat Virtualization

To collect capacity and utilization data for Red Hat Virtualization (RHV), you must add a user to the RHV-M history database for {product-title} to use.

Perform this procedure on the PostgreSQL server where the history database (ovirt_engine_history) is located. Usually, this is the RHV-M server.

. Using SSH, access the RHV-M database server as the root user:
+
----
$ ssh root@example.postgres.server
----
+
. Switch to the postgres user:
+
----
# su - postgres
----
+
[NOTE]
====
For RHV 4.2, the PostgreSQL database is delivered as a software collection in version 9.5 and must be enabled first. Therefore, to run the following psql commands, you will need to enable the _rh-postgresql95_ collection and load into the current shell prompt using the source command: 

$ source /opt/rh/rh-postgresql95/enable
====
+
. Create the user for {product-title_short} to be granted read-only access to the history database:
+
----
$ psql -U postgres -c "CREATE ROLE cfme WITH LOGIN ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '[password]';" -d ovirt_engine_history
----
. Grant the newly created user permission to connect to the history database:
+
----
$ psql -U postgres -c "GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE ovirt_engine_history TO cfme;"
----
+
. Grant the newly created user usage of the public schema:
+
----
$ psql -U postgres -c "GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO cfme;" ovirt_engine_history
----
+
. Generate the rest of the permissions that will be granted to the newly created user and save them to a file:
+
----
$ psql -U postgres -c "SELECT 'GRANT SELECT ON ' || relname || ' TO cfme;' FROM pg_class JOIN pg_namespace ON pg_namespace.oid = pg_class.relnamespace WHERE nspname = 'public' AND relkind IN ('r', 'v', 'S');" --pset=tuples_only=on  ovirt_engine_history > grant.sql
----
+
. Use the file you created in the previous step to grant permissions to the newly created user:
+
----
$ psql -U postgres -f grant.sql ovirt_engine_history
----
+
. Remove the file you used to grant permissions to the newly created user:
+
----
$ rm grant.sql
----
+
. Exit to the RHV-M database server prompt:
+
----
$ exit
----
+
. Update the server's firewall to accept TCP communication on port 5432:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --add-port=5432/tcp --permanent
----
+
. Enable external md5 authentication.
.. For RHV 4.0 and RHV 4.1, change the authentication method from `ident` to `md5` in the following line in `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`:
+
----
host    all      all    0.0.0.0/0     md5
----
+
.. For RHV 4.2, change the authentication method from `ident` to `md5` in the following line in `/var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql95/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`:
+
----
host    all      all    0.0.0.0/0     md5
----
+
. Enable PostgreSQL to listen for remote connections.
.. For RHV 4.0 and RHV 4.1, update the `listen_addresses` line in `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`:
+
----
listen_addresses  =  '*'
----
+
.. For RHV 4.2, update the `listen_addresses` line in `/var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql95/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`:
+
----
listen_addresses  =  '*'
----
+
. Reload the PostgreSQL configuration.
.. For RHV 4.0 and RHV 4.1:
+
----
# systemctl reload postgresql
----
.. For RHV 4.2:
+
----
# systemctl reload rh-postgresql95-postgresql
----
+


[[data_collection_for_osp]]
=== Data Collection for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform

Before you can collect data from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform (RHEL-OSP) provider, you must install Ceilometer and configure it
to accept queries from external systems.

These instructions require a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 @base
installation of RHEL-OSP and registration to a satellite that has access
to both the `RHEL-OSP` and `RHEL Server Optional` channels. Perform all steps on your RHEL-OSP system.

. Add the required channels and update your system:
+
------
# rhn-channel --add -c rhel-x86_64-server-6-ost-3 -c rhel-x86_64-server-optional-6
# yum update -y
# reboot
------
+
. Install `Ceilometer`:
+
------
# yum install *ceilometer*
------
+
. Install and start the MongoDB store:
+
------
# yum install mongodb-server
# sed -i '/--smallfiles/!s/OPTIONS=\"/OPTIONS=\"--smallfiles /' /etc/sysconfig/mongod
# service mongod start
------
+
. Create the following users and roles:
+
------
# SERVICE_TENANT=$(keystone tenant-list | grep services | awk '{print $2}')
# ADMIN_ROLE=$(keystone role-list | grep ' admin ' | awk '{print $2}')
# SERVICE_PASSWORD=servicepass
# CEILOMETER_USER=$(keystone user-create --name=ceilometer \
--pass="$SERVICE_PASSWORD" \
--tenant_id $SERVICE_TENANT \
--email=ceilometer@example.com | awk '/ id / {print $4}')
# RESELLER_ROLE=$(keystone role-create --name=ResellerAdmin | awk '/ id / {print $4}')
# ADMIN_ROLE=$(keystone role-list | awk '/ admin / {print $2}')
# for role in $RESELLER_ROLE $ADMIN_ROLE ; do
keystone user-role-add --tenant_id $SERVICE_TENANT \
--user_id $CEILOMETER_USER --role_id $role
done
------
+
. Configure the authtoken in `ceilometer.conf`:
+
------
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf keystone_authtoken auth_host 127.0.0.1
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf keystone_authtoken auth_port 35357
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf keystone_authtoken auth_protocol http
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf keystone_authtoken admin_tenant_name services
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf keystone_authtoken admin_user ceilometer
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf keystone_authtoken admin_password $SERVICE_PASSWORD
------
+
. Configure the user credentials in `ceilometer.conf`:
+
------
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf DEFAULT os_auth_url http://127.0.0.1:35357/v2.0
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf DEFAULT os_tenant_name services
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf DEFAULT os_password $SERVICE_PASSWORD
# openstack-config --set /etc/ceilometer/ceilometer.conf DEFAULT os_username ceilometer
------
+
. Start the Ceilometer services:
+
------
# for svc in compute central collector api ; do
  service openstack-ceilometer-$svc start
  done
------
+
. Register an endpoint with the service catalog. Replace `$EXTERNALIFACE`
  with the IP address of your external interface:
+
------
# keystone service-create --name=ceilometer \
--type=metering --description="Ceilometer Service"
# CEILOMETER_SERVICE=$(keystone service-list | awk '/ceilometer/ {print $2}')
# keystone endpoint-create \
--region RegionOne \
--service_id $CEILOMETER_SERVICE \
--publicurl "http://$EXTERNALIFACE:8777/" \
--adminurl "http://$EXTERNALIFACE:8777/" \
--internalurl "http://localhost:8777/"
------
+
. Enable access to Ceilometer from external systems:
+
------
# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dports 8777 -m comment --comment "001 ceilometer incoming" -j ACCEPT
# iptables save
------
+
. Confirm the status of OpenStack and the Ceilometer services:
+
------
# openstack-status
# for svc in compute central collector api ; do
  service openstack-ceilometer-$svc status
  done
------
+
. Verify Ceilometer is working correctly by authenticating as a user
  with instances running, for example `admin`. Pipe the sample for the
  CPU meter to count lines, and confirm that the value changes according
  to the interval specified in `/etc/ceilometer/pipeline.yaml`. The
  default interval is 600 seconds.
+
------
# . ~/keystonerc_admin
# ceilometer sample-list -m cpu |wc -l
------
+
. Add the configured OpenStack provider to {product-title}. See
ifdef::cfme[link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7-Beta/html/managing_providers/cloud_providers#adding_openstack_cloud_providers[Adding OpenStack Providers] in _Managing Providers_.]
ifdef::miq[Managing Providers]
  After adding the provider, capacity and utilization data for your instances
  populate in a few minutes.

[[data_collected]]
=== Capacity and Utilization Data Collected

{product-title} generates charts from the collected data
which can be used to plan your hardware and virtual machine needs.
Depending on the type of data, these charts may include lines for
averages, maximums, minimums, and trends.


[NOTE]
====
For reporting of daily capacity and utilization data, incomplete days
(days with less than 24 hourly data points from midnight to midnight)
that are at the beginning or end of the requested interval are excluded.
Days with less than 24 hourly data points would be inaccurate and
including them would skew trend lines. Therefore, at least one full day
of hourly data from midnight to midnight is necessary for displaying the
capacity and utilization charts under the menu:Compute[Infrastructure] tab.
