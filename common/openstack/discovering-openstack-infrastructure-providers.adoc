= Discovering OpenStack Infrastructure Providers

{product-title} has the ability to discover OpenStack infrastructure providers. In this process, {product-title_short} scans a network segment and searches for the Bare Metal (Ironic) service which runs on port `6385` by default. Note that, currently, the discovery does not work if the Bare Metal service has been moved to a different port.
